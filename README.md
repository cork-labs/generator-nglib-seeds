# generator-nglib-seeds

> Seed templates for generating [boilerplate-nglib](https://github.com/cork-labs/boilerplate-nglib) with [generator-nglib](https://github.com/cork-labs/generator-nglib).

##Â How To

The following will generate a AngularJS library project using Cork Labs defaults.

```
npm install -g yo generator-nglib
mkdir cx.foobar
cd cx.foobar
yo nglib --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ef-ctx/generator-nglib-seeds/master/cork-labs-nglib/.yo-rc.json --tpl git@github.com:ef-ctx/generator-nglib-seeds.git --tpl-path cork-labs-nglib/templates --tpl-branch v0.0.1
```

To generate from a local seed and/or local template:

```
yo nglib --config ~/.yo-rc.json --tpl ~/templates/
```

To skip existing cache of the template repo (if you are not using proper tags, of course) add `--tpl-refresh`.
